# PIE TIME

The binary has PIE enabled, so the address of the binary will be different everytime we run. If we use `objdump` on this binary, we find that the function `win` has an offset of `0x12a7` relative to the beginning of the file and `main` has an offset of `0x133d`.

```sh
objdump -d vuln
```

We get an offset between the `win` and `main` function, which is `0x12a7 - 0x133d = -96`. So all we need to do is add the address of `main` with this offset to get the `win` function's address to jump to.
