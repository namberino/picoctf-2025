# Cookie Monster Secret Recipe

This requires us to find the flag from a cookie. When we try to log into the website, it sends a request to `login.php`. If we check what the request consists of we can find a `secret_cookie` being sent with the request. The `secret_cookie` looks to be base64 encoded, so by running it through a base64 decoder, we get the flag.
