# head-dump

This challenge requires us to identify an endpoint in the website that will dump the memory of the server to us. After looking around the website, I found a link to the website's Swagger page on `#API Documentation`. This page lists all the endpoints in the website and it also list a diagnosis endpoint called `/headdump`. When I accessed this endpoint, I received a hexdump file and running it through `xxd` allows me to find the flag.
